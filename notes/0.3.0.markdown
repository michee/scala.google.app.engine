## breaking changes
In an effort to solve namespace conflicts and to increase consistency among the plugins, a number of sbt plugin authors have discussed on the mailing list, and come up with [sbt plugins best practices](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Plugins-Best-Practices). Here are the changes:

### keys are under `AppengineKeys` object
Keys provided by sbt-appengine now resides in `AppengineKeys` object. If you do rewire any of the keys in `build.sbt`, place the following at the top of file:

    import sbtappengine.Plugin.{AppengineKeys => gae}

Instead of the custom `Appengine` config, settings are by default loaded on `Compile`:

    gae.classpath in Compile := ...

Key names accessible from the shell are now prefixed with `appengine-` (e.g. `appengine-deploy`). To deploy you app to the appengine:

    > appengine-deploy
