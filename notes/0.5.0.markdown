## Backends command support

[Backends Java API Overview][backends]:

> App Engine Backends are instances of your application that are exempt from request deadlines and have access to more memory and CPU than normal instances.

[@stephanos][@stephanos] contributed commands to manage backends [#23][23].

To deploy your backend application(s):

    > appengine-deploy-backends

To start a backend instance in the cloud:

    > appengine-start-backend <backend-name>

To stop a backend instance:

    > appengine-stop-backend <backend-name>
